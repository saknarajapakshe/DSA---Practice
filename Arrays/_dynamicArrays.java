         * Advantages of Dynamic Arrays:
         *    1. Random access of elements. O(1) time complexity.
            *2. Easy to implement.
         *  3. Can easily delete and insert at the end 
         * 4.Good cache locality.
         * 
         * 
         * Disadvantages of Dynamic Arrays:
         *   1. Waste memory
         *  2.Shifting elements is more time consuming. O(n) time complexity.
         * 3. Expanding or shrinking the array is costly. O(n) time complexity.
         * 4. Insertion and deletion of elements is costly. O(n) time complexity.
